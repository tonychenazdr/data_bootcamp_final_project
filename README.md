Project Description:

The Federal Reserve's monetary policy framework took a U-turn earlier this year, cancelling its original plan of further raising interest rates. Yield curve started to flatten since last summer and has inverted after the policy shift earlier this year. Market fear has risen as many interpret an inverted yield curve as an indicator for imminent recession. However, the correlation between the two is unclear and widely debated. This research aims to examine the correlation graphically by  plotting out yield inversion and economic indicators, such as the unemployment rate and the industrial production index.
